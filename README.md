# Files for your environment

These are some files to speed up configuration of your OS X system.

- `.gemrc` configures your Ruby gems to install gems without building the local
  version of their documentation, which can save you some time. Actually, it will
  save you loads of time when building things like Rails. Install it by copying
  this file to `${HOME}/`, e.g. `cp .gemrc ~/`
